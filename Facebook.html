  /*
  <!DOCTYPE html>: This is the document type declaration, which tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.

<html lang="en">: This is the opening <html> tag, and it specifies that the document's language is set to English ("en").

<head>: The <head> section contains meta-information about the document, which is not displayed on the webpage itself but is used for various purposes, including defining the document's title, character encoding, and linking to external resources like stylesheets.

<meta charset="UTF-8">: This <meta> tag specifies the character encoding of the document, which is set to UTF-8, a widely used character encoding that supports a wide range of characters.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: This <meta> tag is used to define the viewport settings for responsive web design. It tells the browser to set the initial scale to 1.0 and adjust the width to the device's width, ensuring that the webpage is displayed properly on different screen sizes.

<title>InternForte IIT BOMBAY Landing Page</title>: This <title> tag sets the title of the webpage, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">: This <link> tag is used to link an external stylesheet file named "styles.css" to the HTML document. This stylesheet is used to define the visual styles (such as fonts, colors, and layout) for the webpage's elements.

<body>: The <body> tag marks the beginning of the webpage's visible content.

<header>: This is the opening <header> tag, which typically contains elements like navigation menus, logos, and other header-related content.

<nav>: The <nav> tag is used to define a navigation menu section within the header.

<ul>: This is an unordered list (bullet-point list) that contains navigation items.

<li>: The <li> tags represent list items within the navigation menu.

Inside the <li> tags, there are <a> (anchor) tags with href attributes. These anchor tags are used to create hyperlinks to different sections of the website or other web pages. Currently, the href attributes are set to "#" as placeholders, which means the links are not functional in this code.

There are also inline styles applied to some of the <li> elements to control their appearance. For example, style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 24px;" is used to set the font weight and font size for the "Intern Crowd" list item, and style="margin-left: 100px;" is used to add left margin to the second list item.

In summary, this code defines the structure of an HTML document for a webpage, including the document's title, character encoding, viewport settings, and a navigation menu within a header. However, it doesn't contain any actual content or functionality beyond the structure and styling.
